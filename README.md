## 🚀 What is Hyperion?

**Hyperion** is an AI‑driven Cognitive Cloud Control System designed to monitor, predict, and autonomously heal cloud infrastructure failures before they impact services.

It mimics how a **human SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)** thinks:

🧠 Understand system dependencies  
📊 Analyze live metrics  
🔮 Predict failures  
⚖️ Assess risk  
🤖 Execute safe recovery

## 🧩 System Architecture

Hyperion is composed of intelligent modules working together:

| Module | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Graph Engine** | Digital twin of cloud infrastructure |
| **CloudWatch Ingestor** | Reads real AWS metrics |
| **Prediction Engine** | Forecasts upcoming failures |
| **Decision Engine** | Chooses best action |
| **Risk Engine** | Prevents dangerous restarts |
| **Action Executor** | Executes recovery |
| **Incident Memory** | Learns from history |

## 🧠 Intelligence Flow

1. Discover infrastructure
2. Build dependency graph
3. Read real-time metrics
4. Predict future load
5. Detect anomaly
6. Evaluate business impact
7. Assess risk
8. Choose safest action
9. Execute recovery
10. Log incident
